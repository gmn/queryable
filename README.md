Queryable JS
------------

Queryable - A tiny, single file database written in Javascript, that emulates a functional subset of mongodb commands. It works in both browser and server. The database itself is stored as a json string. Unlike mongo there are no collections; a separate db is simply returned by each call to open(). Essentially, queryable facilitates structured querying of an array of objects.


## Examples

### Some examples of using queryable.js in node.js:

```js
var queryable = require( 'queryable' );

// There are multiple ways to open a db.
// The simplest is to provide a full path to where you want your database file.
var db = queryable.open( "~/code/mydata.db" );

// ..or you can simply name it, which will start an empty db with this name:
var db = queryable.open( "Database_Name" );

// You can load from a json object that is an Array of Objects.
var db = queryable.open( {db_name:"name",data: [{key:val,key2:val2},{key:val},...] } );

// insert any type of key:value pairs you want
db.insert( {key:"keys can be Anything", comment:"fields don't have to match"} );

// Like collections, many independent db can be open at the same time
var db2 = queryable.open( "~/another.db" );

// It handles any value types
db2.insert( {subarray:[1,2,'buckle',{'my':'shoe'}]} );

// find() works like Mongo; RegExp's are fine
var res = db.find( {key:/regex/} );

// SELECT * WHERE (age = 40);
var res = db.find( {age:40} );

// all rows where age is over 40
// supports: $gt, $lt, $gte, $lte, $ne, $exists
var res = db.find( {age: {'$gt':40}} );

// the first 10 rows where age is over 40 and 'name' exists, sorted by name
var res = db.find({age:{$gt:40},name:{'$exists':true}}).sort({name:1}).limit(10);

// find() returns db_result, which has a length property and rows[] array
// as well as chainable methods like: .sort(), .limit(), .skip(), ..
console.log( 'got ' + res.length + ' rows' );


/*
 * a real example - populate from string
 */
// literal data can be a string or an object
var json_string = '[
  {"name":"Cathy"},
  {"name":"Carol","sex":"f"},
  {"name":"John","sex":"m"},
  {"name":"Cornelius","sex":"m"}]';

var queryable = require('queryable');

var db = queryable.open({db_name:"MyDatabase",data:json_string});

// delete a row
db.remove({name:'Cathy'});

// get names that start with 'C'
db.find({name:/^C/}, function(res) {
  console.log( db.db_name + ' contains these names that start with C:' );
  res.rows.forEach(function(x){
    console.log(' ' + x.name);
  });
});

/* outputs:
MyDatabase contains these names that start with C:
 Carol
 Cornelius
*/
```

Callbacks work now too (finally):

```js
  db.distinct('name',{age:{$lte:35}},function(res) {
    res.rows.forEach(function(row){
      console.log( row.name );
    });
  });
```

## API

### The queryable.open() function
There are essentially 3 forms of open(): no args, a single string, a single object. The most concise way to specify what you want is to use a `config` object, and specify each param individually. Failing that, merely providing a fullpath string, where you want your database to live, is sufficient in most cases.

#### queryable.open()
* `db_name` = defaults to '*test.db*' in node, '*queryable*' in web browser
* `db_dir`  = default is current working directory: (eg. /home/kooldude)
* `db_path` = concatenation of: (db_dir + db_name) (eg. /home/kooldude/test.db)

#### queryable.open(string)
* First it tries string as a fullpath; if file is found: `db_name`, `db_dir`, and `db_path` are set.
* If a file isn't found, it tries string as a directory where it will create the database using the default `db_name`.
* If it isn't a directory or an existing file, string is assumed to be a fullpath where the file will be saved to. `db_path`, `db_dir`, and `db_name` are set from that.

#### queryable.open(object)
If argument is an object, these configuration variable are looked for in it:
* **db_name**       If none supplied, it either takes one from db_path or defaults to '*queryable*' or '*test.db*' in the browser or in node respectively.
* **db_path**       The fullpath where the database lives. Irrelevant in the browser. The database file is written to db_path everytime save() is called, and read from it in open() if an existing file is discovered at the location.
* **db_dir**        Defaults to current working directory if db_path or db_dir are not supplied.
* **use_gzip**      Can manually specify file is of type gzip. This is useful for files lacking the '.gz' extension. Note: currently gzbz must be present for this to work.
* **data**          If this is set, the database can be populated outright by an argument to data. data can be string or json. It must be in the form of an **Array of Zero or More Objects of Any Kind**.
